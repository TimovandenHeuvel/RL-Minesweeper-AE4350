# RL-Minesweeper-AE4350
A Reinforcement Learning agent using DQN with CNN for the TU Delft Aerospace Engineering Master course AE4350 Bio-Inspired Intelligence and Learning for Aerospace Applications

There are several Python files available in the repository. The main file with which the final code and the 'master' run can be found under the name "Minesweeper_MasterRun". This file contains the CNN agent with memory transfer and the improved hyperparameters after sensitivity analysis. These values can be changed at will.
Additionally, there are several other files available, such as the MLP agent used earlier in the project, as well as the CNN agent without memory transfer and the Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis files of the CNN agent with memory transfer. Finally, some files used to combine the plots of all the runs of each sensitivity analysis hyperparameter are shared.

The results folder contains all the CSV files that store the data of all runs performed during the project and that are cited in the report. These are already visualized in the report and kept mainly for verification purposes. 

Feel free to use this repository for any purpose desired.
